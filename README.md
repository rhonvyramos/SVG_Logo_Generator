# SVG_Logo_Generator
## Description
This is a terminal prompter that allows the user to generate a simple logo made up of three characters inside one of three shapes. Users can use the prompts to select the text they wish to display, to select the shape they would like to use, and to select a predefined color or HEX color for both the text and the shape.

## Installation
Download the repository onto your machine and run node index.js inside an integrated terminal. The repository must also have the inquiry npm installed.

## Use
After running node index.js inside an integrated terminal, the user will be greeted by a series of prompts. Users can input up to three characters for the displayed text and can select either a circle, triangle, or square as the background shape. When prompted for a color, the user can select one of the predefined colors available or select "manual color hex input" to manually input a color HEX value.

When all prompts are exhausted, the output will be a file named "svg_logo.svg" that is an .svg file containing the svg markup syntax that can be inserted within proper html markup. Displayed in a browser through the html, the svg syntax will display the desired logo.
